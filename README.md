# Steel-Rods-Detection-in-Image-Video

🔍 Project: Automated Steel Rods Counting using Computer Vision and Deep Learning
🏢 Client: A steel manufacturing company

🔍 Business Problem:
The company was facing challenges with the manual counting of different steel products in images, resulting in time-consuming inventory management, errors, and reduced operational efficiency.

🔍 Business Solution:
We proposed developing a deep learning model using state-of-the-art algorithms to accurately identify the number of different steel products in an image. This enables automated image analysis and product identification. The model was trained on a large dataset of steel product images and seamlessly integrated into the company's existing processes.

💻 Technology Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Yolo, RCNN Models
Web Framework Libraries: Flask
Deployment Tools: AWS

💼 Business Benefits:
✅ Reduce manual counting by 40%, improving operational efficiency and saving time
✅ Achieve high accuracy in identifying the number of steel products in an image (80% or higher), reducing errors and improving inventory management
✅ Increase profits by reducing overstocking or stockouts, generating profits of $70K per annum
